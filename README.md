# NounsPhx

## What is this

A simple version of the game nouns in a bucket.
The plan is to start out as simple as possible and keep building on the game to add more features.

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:
  * Ensure postgres is running
  * Ensure both erlang, elixir, and phoenix are installed
  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
